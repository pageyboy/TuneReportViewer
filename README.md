# TuneReportViewer (WIP)

This is a C# rewrite of my TuneReportViewer application which was written in VB.Net and prior to learning about Source Control...

The aim was to get a better grasp of C# and to provide a more modern and response UI.

# To Do

- [x] Extract and tabulate data
- [ ] Chart tabulated data: Data charts but data format needs improvement
- [ ] Mouse over event to show line in table: Makes it easier to exclude data points without scrolling through a potentially large table
- [ ] Export as CSV
- [ ] Improve data filters
